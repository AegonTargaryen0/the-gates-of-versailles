POLITICS_Alexei_Khvostov_DESC:0 "Aleksey Nikolayevich Khvostov was born into a noble family. As such he has never had the struggles that many Russians go through daily. After finishing an education of a high standard he went on to become a student in law. He has held many positions within Russian politics. Governor of Minsk, President of the Russian Assembly, Minister of The Interior. Despite his experience in Russian Politics, he is notoriously incompetent. He has never been able to connect to the Russian people and he is seen by peasants and critics alike as a Nobles' Man. Many of his Land reforms have been infamous disasters. Whenever a minister disagrees with him he simply appoints a new one.\n\nNot much is known about Alexei's personality, but with him being the former president of the right-wing party Russian Assembly, we know that he is not as democratic as he might claim to be. The Duma Order 1289 ended the practice of jews having to convert to Orthodox Christianity to migrate to Russia, which was made by Alexei, was simply put 'a scheme to gain funding from Jewish bankers'. The practice is still very much around. Many retellings of personal conversations claim that Alexei has spoken out against Jews in much more violent ways. In a private conversation with Alexei, Mikhail Tukhachevsky claims that Alexei said that 'All Jews belong in Siberia'. Alexei, of course, says that these claims are simply that. Claims."

##Events
russia.3.t:0 "Grand Coalition"
russia.3.d:0 "The time is nigh. Everybody knows that is almost unsalvageable. Discontent in all factions of society have gone up. There is only one way to save the Motherland. In a surprising manner, Alexei Khvostov has announced a grand coalition. While previously the Duma was mostly comprised of members from the Russian Assembly. This led to only reforms and decisions, made to be good for the party, getting through. Well now Alexei has announced a reshuffle of the parliament. This will include more balanced seating between the parties. This should be good, but many think that this is unconstitutional and is only prolonging the inevitable."
russia.3.a:0 "Is Russia saved?"
russia.4.t:0 "Political Crisis"
russia.4.d:0 "We tried our best at satisfying everyone. We gave the radicals more influence. We gave more seats to the moderates. Yet, no one is satisfied. Both sides of the radicals despise each other to the point of killing one another. The liberals stand displeased as the anarchy and disorder resumes. The Marshals, who hold no power in the Duma, still exert their influence through different means. Nothing seems to be working, and nobody listens to what Alexei has to say."
russia.4.a:0 "Has our time come?"
russia.5.t:0 "The Kremlin Meeting"
russia.5.d:0 "Every night when the Duma sessions are over, Alexei leaves for his personal quarters in the Kremlin. And tonight was no exception. Alexei was sick of all the brawling and cockfighting in the Duma, so he was off to a small feast. After devouring an entire pig with his wife, he was off to have a drink, at a fancy cocktail place. Whilst sipping on a martini, he was approached by three men. They told him \“Alexei, come with us, you are in grave danger\”. Alexei, without any real choice, quit his lounging and followed the men. They entered a truck, and left to the outskirts of the city.\n \nAlexei fell asleep during the car ride, as he was more than a bit tipsy. When he woke up, he had a bag on his head. Confusedly, he asked \“is anyone out there? Hello\”. No response. Alexei was in danger, and he started panicking. “Please let me go! Let me go! I just want to leave, please!\”. Alexei let out a scream as an ice pick went straight through his head. Shortly after, a police squad arrived at the church, where they found his body. A note was left on a chair, reading \“this is for what you did to the jews, you antisemite\”. There are currently no suspects."
russia.5.a:0 "What now?"
russia.6.t:0 "A Quiet Revolution"
russia.6.d:0 "Today started as any other day. The ground was freezing, the birds were chirping and Petrograd was busy as usual. In the Duma, things had a normal beginning. At least it had become normal recently. Until the Moscow Crash, things had been well. We had been a perfect example of a democracy. An eastern on, at that. But after the Moscow Crash, things had changed. Nobody were satisfied. And today, this had built up to a melting point.\n \nThings began normally in the Duma. People found their seats, and Alexei opened the day. Around half an hour later, the hall went silent. The Duma doors opened, and a platoon of Russian soldiers entered. At the very end were Lev Kamenev, Grigory Zinoviev and Lazar Kaganovich. Everyone were shocked. It had been long since people had seen those revolutionaries. The Soldiers went up to remove Alexei from his podium. He reluctantly followed them. Lev Kamenev took his position and said \”today is a new dawn for Russia. The revolution is here, and it shall never allow the decay of Russia again\”. The Duma was disassembled shortly after, and the soldiers and revolutionaries are still situated in the Duma. News has reached the nation, and people are beginning to sharpen their knives already."
