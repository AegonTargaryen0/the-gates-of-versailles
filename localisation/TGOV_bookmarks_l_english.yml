 ITA_THE_GATES_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "Italy has been subject to constant invasion throughout the past few centuries. The Italian people never managed to unite which led to foreign powers such as, France and Britain to take control over the peninsula.\n\nHowever times are changing and the people of Italy are beginning to see that they need to unify to repel their occupiers, no matter the cost. Mussolini came to power after Italy's prestige and honor was mutilated during the great war. The House of Garibaldi fled Italy and the people clammored for Mussolini and the new regime."
 JAP_THE_GATES_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "Japan was not deeply affected by the Napoleonic Wars, and stayed roughly the same until 1832, when the United States demanded trade. After a 3-week war with America, Japan created an empire and set its sights on Korea, but after failing to defeat them, the army's popularity diminished, and no one was supportive of them anymore.\n\nWith an unmodernized industry and an unpopular army, Japan has to find a way to survive this age, darkened by the war and tension in Europe. With Hirohito in charge, will they live to see another decade, or fade away in the mists of war?"
