italy.23.d:0 "With the first world war over the Italian Confederation seemed like it would collapse any second and it did. The Blackshirts or Fascists led by Benito Mussolini overtook Rome and declared that he himself is the soul leader of Italy. The Authoritarian Government was exiled to Naples and the fascists were in 100% control of Italy. The Government is still unstable with many resistance groups such as the Communists, Conservatives, Liberals and advocates for the authoritarian government causing havoc in the country. What will happen next to Italy descend into Communist nonsense, go into free elections or dive back into the traditional authoritarian government?"
