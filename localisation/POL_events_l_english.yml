poland.20.t:0 "Labor Lottery"
poland.20.d:0 "Today came a message from the ministry of economic affairs. The ministers came up with the idea of a 'Labor Lottery'. A monthly lottery where the winner gets a new, very prestigious, job. The tickets cost a lot, so the job will also pay alot. The one thing the peasants don't know is that the jobs aren't that prestigious, and that they will often have to move far away to work. Through this scheme, we can only do one thing, and that is earn a lot of money."

poland.21.t:0 "The Future of Poland"
poland.21.d:0 "Poland is at a crossroads. There are various contenders looking to seize power, either peacefully or unpeacefully. There are still democratic sympathizers from the old government. The fascist party is also gaining a lot of traction. Many of our advisors are suggesting that Anders is preparing a coup, however it is clearly unjustified and it lacks evidence. Many young poles are seeing the success of communism in Prussia, and they are joining secret underground communist parties. Still, the ideal future is one in which Sikorski remains in power. "

poland.22.d:0 "Ever since Sikorski and his commanders took over Poland, the people have been miserable. Food shortages and government suppression has lowered the content of the citizens. Well today was the boiling points of these rebels. A group of students, liberals, intellectuals, communists, bureaucrats, diplomats, soldiers, miners, fascists, autocrats, peasants, ukrainians and germans, really everyone who was sick of his rule. The guards protecting the gates at the ministry of defense, where Sikorski was staying, was eventually overwhelmed, in what experts called 'a modern day Storm of The Bastille'. Before the rebels could reach his office, he was long gone. Witnesses saw a convoy leaving the area around the time the office was found empty. His location is unknown now, but he is probably headed to Hungary, Lithuania or Ukraine, where he will reciece asylum. Sikorskis departure has left a power gap in Poland. The various rebel factions, the communists, fascists, liberals, soldiers are already grapping what straws they can."
