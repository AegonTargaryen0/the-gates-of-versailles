poland.20.t:0 "Labor Lottery"
poland.20.d:0 "Today came a message from the ministry of economic affairs. The ministers came up with the idea of a 'Labor Lottery'. A monthly lottery where the winner gets a new, very prestigious, job. The tickets cost a lot, so the job will also pay alot. The one thing the peasants don't know is that the jobs aren't that prestigious, and that they will often have to move far away to work. Through this scheme, we can only do one thing, and that is earn a lot of money."
poland.20.a:0 "Nothing bad can come out of this, right?"
poland.21.t:0 "The Future of Poland"
poland.21.d:0 "Poland is at a crossroads. There are various contenders looking to seize power, either peacefully or unpeacefully. There are still democratic sympathizers from the old government. The fascist party is also gaining a lot of traction. Many of our advisors are suggesting that Anders is preparing a coup, however it is clearly unjustified and it lacks evidence. Many young poles are seeing the success of communism in Prussia, and they are joining secret underground communist parties. Still, the ideal future is one in which Sikorski remains in power. "
poland.21.a:0 "The future is uncertain"
poland.22.t:0 "The End of Sikorski"
poland.22.d:0 "Ever since Sikorski and his commanders took over Poland, the people have been miserable. Food shortages and government suppression has lowered the content of the citizens. Well today was the boiling points of these rebels. A group of students, liberals, intellectuals, communists, bureaucrats, diplomats, soldiers, miners, fascists, autocrats, peasants, ukrainians and germans, really everyone who was sick of his rule. The guards protecting the gates at the ministry of defense, where Sikorski was staying, was eventually overwhelmed, in what experts called 'a modern day Storm of The Bastille'. Before the rebels could reach his office, he was long gone. Witnesses saw a convoy leaving the area around the time the office was found empty. His location is unknown now, but he is probably headed to Hungary, Lithuania or Ukraine, where he will reciece asylum. Sikorskis departure has left a power gap in Poland. The various rebel factions, the communists, fascists, liberals, soldiers are already grapping what straws they can."

poland.23.t:0 "Opening of the Sejm"
poland.23.d:0 "Earlier this morning, the country was shocked, but in a good way. The doors of the Sejm were opened. A handful of politicians, known in higher circles as the 'The Inner Ministry', the politicians announced that they would form an emergency government, and that national elections would commence shortly. Currently, the conservatives are set to take the lead, but the last election was a long time ago, and the people's opinion is yet unknown. Of course the communist and fascist parties are banned in the upcoming election, but the newly formed liberal and social democratic parties are a threat to the conservative status quo."

poland.24.t:0 "National Elections"

However seeing the joy of the other european democracies in Russia and Scandinavia, others are suggesting that the liberals might pull ahead. Of course the unthinkable option is that the social democrats will pull ahead. Of course, that is just a childish fantasy."

The union's goal is to promote free trade and unity with the invited nations. Many liberals have praised this proposal, as it will strengthen slavic unity.
