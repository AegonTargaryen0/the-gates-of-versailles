Habibullāh did not believe the Sufi but he did remember it for the rest of his life. Habibullāh’s father was a veteran of the Afghani-Persian war, and the Anglo-Afghan war. With money from the government in Kabul arriving by the month and with Habibullāh’s father making money teaching marksmanship they eventually moved to Kabul where Habibullāh would receive his military education. In 1909 Habibullāh graduated the war college and would serve in the Afghan army. In 1920 Habibullāh had grown in popularity significantly because of his denouncement of the monarchy and his anti-british beliefs. This eventually caught the eyes of Russia and France who wanted the pro-British king out of power. Habibullāh received payments from French and Russian generals as well as from the governments of France and Russia. Habibullāh formed a militia of 10,000 and stormed the king’s palace and took power over the country. Habibullāh was then crowned king the next week on May 21st 1921 and Afghanistan was proclaimed an “Islamic Kingdom”. Habibullā reminded by the old Sufi from his childhood now realized his destiny of ruling Afghanistan."
