 ITA_THE_GATES_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "Italy has been subject to constant invasion throughout the past few centuries. The Italian people never managed to unite which led to foreign powers such as, France and Britain to take control over the peninsula.\n\nHowever times are changing and the people of Italy are beginning to see that they need to unify to repel their occupiers, no matter the cost. Mussolini came to power after Italy's prestige and honor was mutilated during the great war. The House of Garibaldi fled Italy and the people clammored for Mussolini and the new regime."
